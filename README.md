# Ada Voice Assistant

A voice assistant powered by Azure OpenAI, Twilio, and FastAPI that can give my wedding guests a hint to the Bingo game on the day of the event, as well as offering some cool dad jokes (cause why not).

## Features

- üé≠ Interactive voice conversations using Azure OpenAI
- üîä Real-time audio streaming via Twilio Media Streams
- ü§ñ Two main capabilities:
  - Give my guests a hint to the Bingo game that we're about to play on the day of my wedding
  - Offer to repeat the hint or dad jokes if guests are calling back (use Make.com to store caller information and chat history in a Google Spreadsheet)
- üéôÔ∏è Natural conversation with voice interruption support
- üìù Session-based conversation tracking
